# Project Description#



Data Import: This section describes the initial setup where necessary Python libraries are imported. These libraries include pandas (for data manipulation and analysis), numpy (for numerical computations), seaborn and matplotlib (for data visualization).

Dataset Overview: Here, a dataset named 'menu.csv' is loaded into a pandas DataFrame, which is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns potentially of different types. The df.head() function is used to display the first few rows of the DataFrame, providing a glimpse into the data's structure and contents.

Nutritional Analysis: This section focuses on analyzing the nutritional information from the dataset. Key metrics such as calories, total fat, and carbohydrates are likely examined. The average calorie content across menu items might be calculated. Data visualizations, such as Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots and scatter plots, may be used to illustrate the distribution of these nutritional values.

Category Insights: The analysis provides insights into different menu categories, such as 'Beef & Pork', 'Chicken & Fish', and 'Salads'. The nutritional content specific to each category, such as saturated fat, cholesterol, and vitamins, may be discussed. This could provide insights into which categories tend to have higher or lower nutritional values.

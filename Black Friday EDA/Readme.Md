# Problem Statement
The retail company aims to predict customer purchase amounts based on various factors such as demographics and product details. The goal is to build a model that can accurately estimate the purchase amount a customer is likely to spend.

## Data Preparation
The dataset used for this task includes several features:

- **Customer Demographics**: These might include age, gender, occupation, marital status, and income1.
- **Product Details**: Information about the products purchased, such as product category, brand, and price.
- **Purchase Amount**: The target variable we want to predict.

Data cleaning steps involve:

- Handling missing values (imputing or removing them).
- Encoding categorical variables (e.g., converting gender or occupation into numerical representations).
- Ensuring data consistency and correctness.

## Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is crucial to understand the relationships between features and the target variable.

Key EDA steps:

- Summary Statistics: Compute mean, median, standard deviation, etc., for numerical features.
- Visualization: Create bar plots, histograms, or scatter plots to visualize the distribution of features.
- Correlation Analysis: Examine correlations between features and the target variable.

For example, we might explore:

- How does age impact purchase amounts?
- Are certain occupations associated with higher spending?
- Is there a gender-based difference in purchasing behavior?

## Model Building
Weâ€™ll use machine learning techniques to build a predictive model.

Steps involved:

- Feature Selection: Choose relevant features for modeling.
- Feature Scaling: Normalize numerical features (e.g., using Min-Max scaling or Z-score normalization).
- Train-Test Split: Divide the dataset into training and testing subsets.
- Model Selection: Linear regression is commonly used for predicting continuous values (like purchase amounts).
- Model Training: Fit the model using the training data.
- Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
